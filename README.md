# Build Instructions

## PhoneGap Desktop

Follow the Getting Started steps located [here](http://docs.phonegap.com/getting-started/1-install-phonegap/desktop/) to install the PhoneGap Desktop Development Platform. Once installed, open the downloaded project in the PhoneGap Application. Once the server is up and running, there will be a green bar at the bottom containing the IP of the PhoneGap server. Because PhoneGap is technically running a WebView, you can click on this link to run the application in your browser.

## PhoneGap Mobile App

Install the PhoneGap Mobile App following the steps located [here](http://docs.phonegap.com/getting-started/2-install-mobile-app/). Once it is running, type in the IP of your PhoneGap server, and PhoneGap will take care of the rest.

# Editing

On every file change to the project, PhoneGap will reload. Your app will be updated in real time.
